# Stringing configurations for stringed instruments.
#
# Each instrument has courses (strings played together).
# course_semitones defines additional strings in a course relative to the pitch.
#
# Examples:
#   - [] = single string
#   - [12] = doubled an octave higher
#   - [0] = doubled in unison
