The **head_music** Ruby gem provides a toolkit for working with Western music theory. Model and manipulate the fundamental elements of music including pitches, scales, key signatures, intervals, and chords.

## Features

- **Western Music Theory Fundamentals**: Work with pitches, scales, intervals, chords, and key signatures
- **Musical Analysis**: Analyze harmonic progressions, voice leading, and counterpoint
- **Style Analysis**: Rules for species counterpoint and voice leading
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages (English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish)
- **Instrument Modeling**: Extensive database of musical instruments with ranges and properties

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'head_music'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install head_music

## Quick Start

```ruby
require 'head_music'

# Work with pitches and intervals
pitch = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch.get('C4')
higher_pitch = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch.get('E4')
interval = HeadMusic::Analysis::DiatonicInterval.new(pitch, higher_pitch)
puts interval.name  # => "major third"

# Create scales
scale = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Scale.get('C', :major)
puts scale.pitches.map(&:to_s)  # => ["C4", "D4", "E4", "F4", "G4", "A4", "B4"]

# Analyze chords
pitches = %w[C4 E4 G4].map { |p| HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch.get(p) }
chord = HeadMusic::Analysis::PitchSet.new(pitches)
puts chord.major_triad?  # => true
```
