## [Unreleased]

## [9.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Added `HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch::Parser` for strict pitch parsing
- Added `HeadMusic::Rudiment::RhythmicValue::Parser` for rhythmic value parsing
- Both parsers provide standardized `.parse()` class method API

### Changed
- `Pitch.from_name` now uses `Pitch::Parser` internally
- `RhythmicValue.get` now uses `RhythmicValue::Parser` internally
- `Note.get` now parses "pitch rhythmic_value" strings inline without Parse module

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `HeadMusic::Parse::Pitch` class
- **BREAKING**: Removed `HeadMusic::Parse::RhythmicValue` class
- **BREAKING**: Removed `HeadMusic::Parse::RhythmicElement` class
- **BREAKING**: Removed entire `HeadMusic::Parse` module

### Migration Guide

If you were using the removed Parse classes, migrate as follows:

```ruby
# Before (v8.x)
parser = HeadMusic::Parse::Pitch.new("C#4")
pitch = parser.pitch

# After (v9.x)
pitch = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch.get("C#4")
# or for strict parsing:
pitch = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Pitch::Parser.parse("C#4")
```

```ruby
# Before (v8.x)
parser = HeadMusic::Parse::RhythmicValue.new("dotted quarter")
value = parser.rhythmic_value

# After (v9.x)
value = HeadMusic::Rudiment::RhythmicValue.get("dotted quarter")
# or for strict parsing:
value = HeadMusic::Rudiment::RhythmicValue::Parser.parse("dotted quarter")
```

```ruby
# Before (v8.x)
parser = HeadMusic::Parse::RhythmicElement.new("F#4 dotted-quarter")
note = parser.note

# After (v9.x)
note = HeadMusic::Rudiment::Note.get("F#4 dotted-quarter")
```
