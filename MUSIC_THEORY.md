## Music theory and concepts

The rudiments of music theory are built up piece-by-piece.

letter name
  - C, D, E, F, G, A, B, …
  - equivalent to:
   - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si/ti, …

alteration
  - sharp, flat, double sharp, double flat
  - optional
  - none is same as 'natural'
  - found in key signatures
  - found in bars as accidentals

spelling
  - letter name + alteration
  - example: "E♭"

register
  - an integer typically between 0 and 8
  - represents the octaves of an 88-key piano
  - scientific pitch notation
    - middle C is C4
    - increments between B and C
      - a half step below C4 is B3.

pitch
  - spelling + register
  - example: "E♭3"

rhythmic unit
  - duration
  - expressed in fractions (or multiples) of a standard whole note
    - whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth, …
    - breve, …

rhythmic value (duration)
  - a rhythmic unit plus optional augmentation dots
  - augmentation dots extend the duration of the rhythmic unit
    - one dot extends the rhythmic value 50%
    - two dots extend the rhythmic value 75%
    - two dots extend the rhythmic value 87.5%

rest
  - a rhythmic value that passes in silence

note
  - pitch + rhythmic value
  - example: "E♭3 dotted quarter"

unpitched note
  - an unpitched percussion note, such as a drum hit
  - a sounded rhythmic value without a specific pitch

tied duration
  - combines multiple rhythmic values into one longer note
  - ties allow rhythmic values to be combined across barlines or strong beats

articulation
  - a category of expressions that modify how one or more notes are performed.
  - level of connection
    - staccatissimo - the most staccato, even shorted and more clipped
    - staccato – detatched (shortened to lease space between adjacent notes)
    - tenuto - held of the full value
    - legato - smoothly connected
  - emphasis
    - accent - play with emphasis or a stronger attack
    - marcato - markedly emphasized
  - instrument specific
    - bowings
    - breath mark
    - roll mark
